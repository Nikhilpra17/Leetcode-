There are multiple approaches to solve this problem. Here are a few possible approaches with their time complexities:

Two Pointers (Start from the end):

Initialize three pointers: p1 pointing to the end of nums1, p2 pointing to the end of nums2, and p pointing to the end of the merged array (nums1).
Compare the elements at nums1[p1] and nums2[p2], and place the larger element at nums1[p].
Decrement p and the corresponding pointer (p1 or p2) based on which element was larger.
Repeat the above step until p1 or p2 becomes less than 0.
If there are any remaining elements in nums2, copy them to nums1.
Time complexity: O(m + n)
