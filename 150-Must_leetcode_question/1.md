# 88. Merge Sorted Array

There are multiple approaches to solve this problem. Here are a few possible approaches with their time complexities:

### 1st Method - Two Pointers (Start from the end):

-Initialize three pointers: p1 pointing to the end of nums1, p2 pointing to the end of nums2, and p pointing to the end of the merged array (nums1).
-Compare the elements at nums1[p1] and nums2[p2], and place the larger element at nums1[p].
-Decrement p and the corresponding pointer (p1 or p2) based on which element was larger.
-Repeat the above step until p1 or p2 becomes less than 0.
-If there are any remaining elements in nums2, copy them to nums1.
-***Time complexity: O(m + n)***

### 2nd Method Merge and Sort:

-Copy the elements of nums2 into the last n positions of nums1.
-Sort the entire nums1 array using a sorting algorithm like Merge Sort or Arrays.sort().
-***Time complexity: O(log(m + n))***
