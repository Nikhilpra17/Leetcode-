# 22. Generate Parentheses


### Approach : 
*In the generateParenthesis function:*

- We create an empty list result to store the generated combinations.
- We start the backtracking process by calling the backtrack function with an empty string current, initial open count open and close count close as 0, and the maximum number of pairs max.
- The backtrack function is a recursive function that explores all possible combinations of parentheses.
- In the backtrack function, we have the following cases:
- If the length of the current string reaches max * 2, it means we have formed a valid combination of parentheses, so we add it to the result list and return.
- If the open count is less than max, it means we can add an opening parenthesis to the current string. We recursively call the backtrack function with the updated current string, increment the open count, and keep the close count the same.
- If the close count is less than the open count, it means we can add a closing parenthesis to the current string. We recursively call the backtrack function with the updated current string, keep the open count the same, and increment the close count.
- After the backtracking process completes, we return the result list containing all the valid combinations of well-formed parentheses.<br>
