# 79. Word Search



### Approach : 
***Backtracking algorithm explores all possible paths in the board to find a matching word. It avoids revisiting cells that have already been visited in the current path to ensure that the same letter cell is not used more than once.***

The exist function takes the board and word as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the word exists in the board.

*In the exist function:*

- We first check for edge cases where the board is empty or has no rows/columns. If either of these conditions is true, we return false.
- We iterate through each cell in the board, and if the cell contains the first character of the word, we start the backtracking process.
- The backtrack function is a recursive function that checks if the current cell matches the character at the given index of the word. If they match, we proceed with the backtracking process.
- In the backtrack function, we handle various cases:
- If the index reaches the length of the word, it means we have found the entire word, so we return true.
- If the current cell is out of bounds, already visited, or does not match the character at the current index, we return false.
- We mark the current cell as visited and recursively explore the neighboring cells in all four directions (up, down, left, right) to find the next character of the word.
- After exploring all possible paths, we mark the current cell as unvisited to allow it to be visited again in other paths.
- Finally, if no path is found that matches the word, we return false.
