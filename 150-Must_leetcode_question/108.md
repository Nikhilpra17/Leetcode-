# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

### Approach : 

- In the mergeKLists function, you recursively divide the array of linked lists into two halves and merge the resulting lists. This process continues until you have only two lists to merge. The mergeLists function handles the merging of two lists using the mergeTwoLists function, which is a standard approach to merging two sorted linked lists.

- The **time complexity of this solution is O(N log k)**, where N is the total number of nodes across all linked lists and k is the number of linked lists. The divide-and-conquer approach reduces the number of merge operations, making it more efficient than merging the lists one by one.
