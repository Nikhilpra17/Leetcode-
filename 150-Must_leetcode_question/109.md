# 53. Maximum Subarray


### Approach : 

**The algorithm used in the above problem is known as Kadane's algorithm. It is an efficient algorithm for finding the maximum sum subarray in a given array of integers.**

- The main idea behind Kadane's algorithm is to keep track of two variables: currentSum and maxSum.

- Initialize currentSum and maxSum to the first element of the array.
- Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
- At each iteration, calculate the current sum by comparing the current element with the sum of the current element and the previous currentSum. Take the maximum of these two values.
- Update maxSum by comparing the current maxSum with the updated currentSum. Take the maximum of these two values.
- Repeat steps 3-4 for all elements of the array.
- After iterating through the entire array, the maxSum will represent the maximum sum of any subarray in the given array.
