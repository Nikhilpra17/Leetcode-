# 274. H-Index

### Approach 1: Bucket sort
The basic idea is to find the H-Index - defined as max value of h such that publisher has atleast h papers each have been cited at least h times

The logic is we need to find  the largest value of h such that there are at least h papers with h citations each.By counting the number of papers with each citation value and then traversing from the highest citation values to lower values, we can find the maximum valid h-index.

- Initialize an array counts with size n + 1, where n is the length of the citations array.

- Iterate through the citations array. For each citation count, increment the corresponding count in the counts array. If the citation count is greater than or equal to n, increment the count at index n. This step counts the number of papers with each citation value.
- Initialize a variable papers to keep track of the cumulative number of papers.
- Traverse the counts array from right to left (from the highest citation value to 0). Starting from the largest possible h-index (which is n), add the number of papers at the current index to the papers count. If the papers count becomes greater than or equal to the current index value, it means there are at least h papers with h citations each. Return the current index as the h-index.
- If no valid h-index is found during the traversal, return 0 as the default case.

- Time complexity : O(n)
- Space complexity : O(n+1)
