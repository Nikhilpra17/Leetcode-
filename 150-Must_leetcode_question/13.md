# 238. Product of Array Except Self

### Approach 1: Multiply All and divided by respective index value (NOT ALLOWED METHOD) 

### Approach 2: One pass

- We will make the array which takes multiple of left hand side and another array takes of right hand side 
- We multiple both to get the respective answer.
- BUT if need to do in O(1) SPACE COMPLEXITY , take the one point to the left as 1 by default   
- Iterate the array take mutiple of nums[i-1] * ans[i-1];
- In the opposite side take 1 as default and multply with ans[i]* right & update the right value as * nums[i]; 
- O(n) TC
- O(1) SC
