# 134. Gas Station

### Approach 1: Brute Force
- Time Complexity - O(N^2)
- Space Complexity - O(1)

### Approach 2: Greedy Approach
- First we will check the total Gas should be greater or equal to the cost , then only it will travel throughout the path
- Now if the currentGas is less than zero, this means that the path is not possible , so we will increase the counter of Start Station.
