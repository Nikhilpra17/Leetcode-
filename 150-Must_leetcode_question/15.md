# 135. Candy

### Approach 1: Brute Force
- Time Complexity - O(N^2)
- Space Complexity - O(n)

### Approach 2: Using two Arrays
- we can use two passes of iteration. In the first pass, we start from the left and give each child one candy more than the previous child if their rating is higher. 
- In the second pass, we start from the right and give each child one candy more than the previous child if their rating is higher. 
- This ensures that we satisfy both requirements of each child having at least one candy and higher-rated children getting more candies.
- Time complexity : O(n) left2right and right2left arrays are traversed thrice.
- Space complexity : O(n) Two arrays left2right and right2left of size n are used.
