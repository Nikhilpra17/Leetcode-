# 27. Remove Element

This is a pretty easy problem, but one may get confused by the term "in-place" and think it is impossible to remove an element from the array without making a copy of the array.

### Approach 1: Two Pointers

- When nums[j] equals to the given value, skip this element by incrementing j++. 
- As long as nums[j]â‰ val , we copy nums[j] to nums[i] and increment both indexes at the same time. Repeat the process until j reaches the end of the array and the new length is i.
