# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
 
### Approach 1: Single pass

**Logic -** 
- We will check if the length of haystack is less than length of needle , we will directly return -1;
- **One Another important observation** is the number of substring present in haystack would be length of needle +1 ;
- So we will traverse i  to haystack.length - needle.length
- we will increse the j counter if the char are matching and is length than the length of needle
- if the length of j is equal to needle length we will return i else return -1;
- Time Complexity: O((n-m) * m), where n is the length of the haystack and m is the length of the needle.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
