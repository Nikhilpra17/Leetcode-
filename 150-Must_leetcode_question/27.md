# 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
 
### Approach 1: Single pass using two pointer

- We use the condition of data in ascending order.
- When the value of summation of two pointers are less than the target , so we will increse the index to look for bigger value 
- When the value of summation of two pointers are greater than the target , so we will decrease the index of first counter to look for smaller value 
- If the value of summation of two pointers are equal to the target, return the indexes.
