# 15. 3Sum

 
### Approach 1: Brute Force

- Time complexity - O(n^3) 
___


### Approach 2: Extension of 2 Sum Approach
- In the two sum question , we sort the array and find the target element with two pointer , one on start and another at end, If the element sum is greater than we lower the second pointer and vice-Versa
- In three sum , we will iterate the pointer to every index and find the two sum after index + 1
- And the final indexs to the HashSet , this will remove the duplicates.
- Time complexity - O(n^2)
