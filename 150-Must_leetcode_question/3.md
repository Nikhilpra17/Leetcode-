# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array


- The problem would have been simpler if we are allowed to use extra space.
- We can create a map which stores all unique array elements as the key and element frequency as the value.
- After populating our map, we get all the unique elements from our array.
- We then iterate our map and push all the keys in our input array
- However, without using extra space it makes it a bit tricky as we have to modify the existing input array

### Approach 1: Two indexes approach

By analyzing the above three key observations, we can derive the following algorithm,

- Start both indexes (insertIndex, i) from 1. (insertIndex and i represents our First and second Index respectively.)
- Check if the previous element is different from the current element (The previous element is the element just before our i index i.e element present at arr[i-1])
- If found different then perform arr[insertIndex] = arr[i] and increment insertIndex by 1 (Increment i index by 1 till we reach end of the array)
- ***Time Complexity: O(N),*** since we only have 2 pointers, and both the pointers will traverse the array at most once.
- ***Space Complexity: O(1),*** since we are not using any extra space.
