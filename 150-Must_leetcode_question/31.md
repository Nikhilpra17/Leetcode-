# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

 
### Approach 1: Brute Force with HashSet
- Generate all possible substrings.
- For each substring, check if it contains repeating characters using a HashSet.
- Keep track of the maximum length found.
- Time Complexity: O(n^3) - Three nested loops for generating substrings and checking for uniqueness.

### Approach 2: Sliding Window with HashSet
- Use a sliding window to maintain the substring without repeating characters.
- Move the left and right pointers of the window to expand or contract the window based on uniqueness.
- Update the maximum length as the window expands.
- Time Complexity: O(n) - Single pass through the input string.
- Space complexity: O(min(n, m)),
