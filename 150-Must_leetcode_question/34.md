# 36. Valid Sudoku
 
### Approach 1: 
- Make the data structure to check the presence of the digit in row, column and box
- traverse the sudoku board and check each digit in the following data structure 
-- For each digit, check if it already exists in the corresponding row, column, or sub-box. 
- If it does, return false.If the digit is unique, mark it as seen in the corresponding data structures.
- If the entire board has been traversed without any conflicts, return true.
- To determine the index of the sub-box for a given cell at (i, j) position, we can use the formula **(i / 3) * 3 + j / 3**.
    - Here's a breakdown of the formula:
        - (i / 3) gives us the row index of the sub-box (0 to 2) that the cell belongs to.
        - (j / 3) gives us the column index of the sub-box (0 to 2) that the cell belongs to.
        - Multiplying (i / 3) by 3 gives us the starting row index of the sub-box in the Sudoku board (0, 3, or 6).
        - Adding (j / 3) gives us the column index offset within the sub-box (0, 1, or 2).
        - The final sum (i / 3) * 3 + j / 3 gives us the unique index of the sub-box (0 to 8) that the cell belongs to.
- Time complexity of this solution is O(1) since the board is fixed at 9x9 size, and the nested loops iterate over constant bounds. 
- Space complexity is also O(1) because the data structures used (rowSeen, colSeen, boxSeen) have fixed sizes.
