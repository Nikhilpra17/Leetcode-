# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

There are multiple approaches to solve this problem. Here are a few possible approaches with their time complexities:

### 1st Method - Two Pointers (Start from the end):

- Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both starting at index 2.
- Iterate through the array starting from index 2 (using the fast pointer) until the end.
- If the current element at nums[fast] is different from the element two positions behind (nums[slow - 2]), it means we have encountered a new unique element, so we update the nums[slow] with the current element.
- Increment both slow and fast pointers.
- After the iteration, the first slow elements in the array will contain the desired result, and we return slow as the length of the updated array.
- ***Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.***
