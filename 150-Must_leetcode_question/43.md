# 202. Happy Number


 
### Approach 1: Using HashMap <br>

- Create a HashSet to store the numbers we have encountered in the sequence.
- Repeat the following steps until n becomes 1 or we encounter a number that has already been seen:
- Convert n to a string and iterate over its digits.
- Calculate the sum of the squares of the digits.
- If the sum is 1, return true since n is a happy number.
- If the sum is already present in the HashSet, return false since we have entered a cycle.
- Otherwise, add the sum to the HashSet and update n to be the sum.
- If we have exited the loop without finding 1, return false since n is not a happy number.
