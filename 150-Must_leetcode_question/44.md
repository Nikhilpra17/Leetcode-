# 13. Roman to Integer
 
### Approach 1: Using HashMap

- we can use a HashMap to keep track of the elements we have encountered so far and their corresponding indices.
- As we iterate over the array, for each element num, we check if it already exists in the HashMap.
- If it does, we compare the difference between the current index and the previously stored index of num to see if it is at most k.
- If it satisfies this condition, we have found two duplicate elements within the desired range, and we return true.
- If not, we update the index of num in the HashMap.
- If we finish iterating over the entire array without finding any duplicate elements within the range k, we return false.
