# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

 
### Approach 1: Using HashMap

- Create a HashSet numSet and add all elements from nums to the set.
- Initialize a variable longestStreak to 0 to keep track of the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
- Iterate over each element num in nums:
    - Check if num - 1 exists in numSet. If it does not exist, this means that num is the start of a potential consecutive sequence.
    - If num - 1 does not exist, we can increment num by 1 and keep track of the length of the consecutive sequence by continuously checking if the incremented value exists in numSet. Increment a local variable currentStreak in this process.
    - If currentStreak is greater than longestStreak, update longestStreak with the value of currentStreak.
- Return longestStreak, which represents the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
