# 228. Summary Ranges

 
### Approach :

To solve this problem, we can iterate over the array nums and construct the ranges based on consecutive elements. We will keep track of the start and end of each range and append the ranges to a result list.

- Create an empty list result to store the summarized ranges.
- Initialize two variables start and end to keep track of the current range's start and end.
- Iterate over each element num in nums:
    - If num + 1 is equal to the next element in nums, update end to num and continue to the next iteration.
    - Otherwise, check if start is equal to end:
    - If they are equal, add the single number start as a range to the result list.
    - If they are not equal, add the range "start->end" to the result list.
- Update start and end to the next element in nums.
- After the loop, check if start is equal to end and add the corresponding range to the result list.
- Return the result list.
