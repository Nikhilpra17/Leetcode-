# 56. Merge Intervals
 
### Approach :
- Sort the intervals array based on the start times of the intervals. This ensures that overlapping intervals are grouped together.
- Create an empty merged list to store the merged intervals.
- Initialize variables start and end with the start and end times of the first interval in the sorted array.
- Iterate over the sorted intervals array starting from the second interval.
- For each interval, check if it overlaps with the previous merged interval by comparing the start time with the current end value:
    - If the start time is less than or equal to end, update the end value to the maximum of the current end and the interval's end time.
    - This extends the merged interval to cover the overlapping portion.
    - If the start time is greater than end, it means the interval is non-overlapping. Add the previous merged interval [start, end] to the merged list and update start and end to the current interval's start and end times.
- After the loop, add the final merged interval [start, end] to the merged list.
- Convert the merged list to a 2D array and return it.
- Time complexity - O(nlogn)
