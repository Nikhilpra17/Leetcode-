# 169. Majority Element
## Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space ?

There are multiple approaches to solve this problem. Here are a few possible approaches with their time complexities:

### Approach 1: Brute Force
- Time complexity : O(n^2)
- Space complexity : O(1)
___

### Approach 2: HashMap
- Time complexity : O(n)
- Space complexity : O(n)
___

### Approach 3: Sorting
- Time complexity : O(nlog(n))
- Space complexity : O(1)
___


### Approach 4: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
If we had some way of counting instances of the majority element as +1+1+1 and instances of any other element as −1-1−1, summing them would make it obvious that the majority element is indeed the majority element.
