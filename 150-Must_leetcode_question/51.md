# 71. Simplify Path
 
### Approach 1: Using Stack

- Create a stack to store the directories in the simplified canonical path.
- Split the given path by the '/' delimiter to obtain an array of directories and iterate over each directory.
- For each directory, perform the following checks:
    - If the directory is empty or '.' (current directory), ignore it and continue to the next directory.
    - If the directory is '..', pop the top directory from the stack if it's not empty. This simulates going up one level in the directory hierarchy.
    - Otherwise, push the directory onto the stack.
- After processing all directories, construct the simplified canonical path by concatenating the directories in the stack with '/' as the separator.
- If the stack is empty, return '/' as the simplified canonical path.
- Otherwise, construct the simplified canonical path by concatenating the directories in the stack with '/' as the separator.
