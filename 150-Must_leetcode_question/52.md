# 155. Min Stack

 
### Approach 1: Using Stack
- Intializing the stack, removing the element, push, top all are easy operation
- The tricky part is only to determine the getMin(), for that we will initialize the two stack , one is normal pop and another one is minStack
- On every iteration , add or remove the element from both the stacks.
- To getMin(), peek out the top element from the minStack();
