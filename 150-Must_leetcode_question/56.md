# 2. Add Two Numbers
 
### Approach 1: 
- Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
- Initialize carry to 0.
- Loop through lists l1 and l2 until you reach both ends and carry is 0.
    - Set x to node l1's value. If l1 has reached the end of l1, set to 0.
    - Set y to node l2's value. If l2 has reached the end of l2, set to 0.
    - Set sum=x+y+carry.
    - Update carry=sum/10.
    - Create a new node with the digit value of (sum mod 10) and set it to current node's next, then advance current node to next.
    - Advance both l1 and l2.
Return dummy head's next node.
