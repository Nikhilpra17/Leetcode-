# 19. Remove Nth Node from End of List
 
### Approach Optimal: 

The main logic behind this question is, the gap between the two pointer would be the same throughout, so if we get to know the index of Node just before the Nth node so we can directly remove it by making firstpointer.next = firstpointer.next.next
