# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II 
 
### Approach Optimal: 

To delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers in a sorted linked list, you can iterate through the list and compare each node with its next node. If they have the same value, it means there are duplicates. In that case, you skip the duplicates by updating the next pointer of the current node to point to the next distinct node.
