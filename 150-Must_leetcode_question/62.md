# 61. Rotate List

 
### Approach Optimal: 

- Calculate the length of the linked list.
- Determine the actual number of rotations required by taking k modulo length.
- If the number of rotations is zero, the list remains unchanged, so return the head as it is.
- Traverse to the (length - rotations)th node in the list.
- Update the pointers to perform the rotation:
    - Set the next node of the (length - rotations)th node to null.
    - Set the next node of the last node in the list to the original head.
- Return the updated head.
