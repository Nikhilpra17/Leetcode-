# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal


### Approach 1: 

- To construct a binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversals, we can use a recursive approach. 
- The idea is to find the root of the current subtree in the preorder array, then locate the corresponding root in the inorder array.
- Once we have the root, we can determine the left and right subtrees based on the inorder array.

- The buildTree function is the entry point that calls the helper function buildTreeHelper to construct the binary tree.
- The buildTreeHelper function takes the preorder and inorder arrays, along with the start and end indices for the current subtree.
- It recursively builds the left and right subtrees based on the values in the arrays.
