# 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal


### Approach 1: 

- Start with the last element of the postorder array as the root node.
- Find the index of the root node in the inorder array.
- Divide the inorder array into left and right subtrees based on the index of the root node.
- Divide the postorder array into left and right subtrees based on the number of elements in the left and right subtrees of the inorder array.
- Recursively construct the left and right subtrees.
