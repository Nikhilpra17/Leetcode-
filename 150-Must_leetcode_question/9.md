# 55. Jump Game

### Approach 1: Greedy
The basic idea is this: at each step, we keep track of the furthest reachable index. The nature of the problem is that for an index to be reachable, each of the previous indices have to be reachable.

- If we reach the end of the loop without encountering an unreachable index, and the maximum reachable index (maxReach) is beyond or at the last index of the array, we can return true because we can reach the last index.
- Or if we get at any point the max is greater or equal to last index , then also return the true .
- If we unable to get the above condition checked , we will return false

- Time complexity : O(n)
- Space complexity : O(1)
