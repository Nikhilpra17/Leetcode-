# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number


### Approach : 

- We define a digitLetters array that maps each digit from 0 to 9 to the corresponding letters on a telephone button.
- In the letterCombinations function, we initialize an empty list combinations to store the resulting combinations.
- If the digits string is empty, we immediately return the empty combinations list.
- Otherwise, we call the backtrack function to generate the combinations.
- The backtrack function takes four parameters: current (the current combination built so far), digits (the original string of digits), index (the current index we're processing in the digits string), and combinations (the list to store the resulting combinations).
- If the index is equal to the length of the digits string, it means we have generated a complete combination, so we add it to the combinations list and return.
- Otherwise, we get the current digit from the digits string and find the corresponding letters from the digitLetters array.
- We iterate through each letter and make a recursive call to backtrack, passing the updated current combination, the digits string, and the next index.
- By exploring all possible letter combinations recursively, we eventually generate all valid combinations and add them to the combinations list.
- **The time complexity of this solution is O(3^N * 4^M), where N is the number of digits that map to 3 letters and M is the number of digits that map to 4 letters. The algorithm explores all possible combinations, and for each digit, it tries out 3 or 4 letters depending on the mapping.**
