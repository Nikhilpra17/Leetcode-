# 77. Combinations

### Approach : 
- This algorithm uses a backtracking approach to generate all combinations of size k from the range [1, n]. The backtrack function takes the current starting index, the total range n, the desired combination size k, the current combination current, and the result list result.

- **It follows these steps:**

- Base case: If the combination size is equal to k, add it to the result and return.
- Iterate from start to n (both inclusive).
- Choose the current number by adding it to the current combination.
- Recursively explore with the chosen number by calling backtrack with an updated starting index (i + 1).
- Unchoose the current number (backtrack) by removing it from the current combination.
- Repeat steps 3-5 for the remaining numbers.
- Return the final result.
- By applying the backtracking algorithm, all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n] will be generated and stored in the result list.
